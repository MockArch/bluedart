What is it?
-----------

A light wrapper around Bluedart's Webservice Soap API. I don't do much of any
validation, but I'll help you sort through the pile of SOAP objects BlueDart
uses.

Installation
------------

The easiest way is via pip or easy_install::

    pip install bluedart

Quick Start
-----------

- Clone this repository.

- Edit the `example_profile.py` file in See `examples/ <examples/>`_ with your bluedart credentials
and run any of the provided examples.
